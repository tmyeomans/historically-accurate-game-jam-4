# historically-accurate-game-jam-4

'The Minotaur' was a submission to the Historically Accurate Game Jam 4 on itchio.  The topic was historically accurate mythology and teams had a week to complete their submission.


The final product is a short labyrinth-themed puzzle game created in Ren'Py.  This was a collaborative effort with S. Latta. Credit for the music and imagery can be found within the game.
